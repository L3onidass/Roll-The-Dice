# Roll-The-Dice
Simple game for practise JS. My first game project sice I started with JS two months ago. Inspiration isn't mine.

Name of the game is Roll The Dice!

The rules of this game are really simple. Just roll the dice and try to collect 100 points
before your opponent. If you roll 1, you lose all current points
and turn. You can protect your collected current points against loss by pressing save
score button but you pass the game to another player.

Wish you good luck and have a fun!
